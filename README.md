# WizardUniversityCurriculum
This repository contains the tentative curriculum to be taught in the Wizard University in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.

Wizard University, a placeholder name, hereafter referred to as "The University" or "University",  is a non-profit university proposed to be established with a completely online presence. This universty is being established with the vision to democraitze education by providing free-of-cost education to everyone who wishes to learn. 

The University will only teach Computer Science and Engineering and related areas, as of now, with provision to expand its areas of teaching in the future, if and when necessary. The related areas include, but are not limited to, fields such as Entrepreneurship, and Career Preparation in Computer Science. 

The whole curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering is divided into 10 parts, hereafter known as "Departments", each department dealing with a separate area. A person, at any given time, taking any course from any department of the university is hereafter referred to as the "Student" of the university. 

Each department will have individual courses that a student enrolled in the university can take.

The student can opt to enroll in either the full course schedule of the university, or take a specialized track, as prescribed by the university. For a student to be considered successful in a course, they would need to have an overall score of 75% or above. 

For specialized tracks, the university will prescribe a list of courses after completion of which the student can be said to have completed that specialized track. If the student opts for a specialized track they need to complete the complete list of courses from possibly differnt departments that the university has prescribed. 
If the student feels that they already possess the knowledge of the areas covered in the course, they can opt to directly complete all the assignments, projects, and tests that the university has set for that particular course. However in this case, the student would need to complete the course with an overall score of 90% or above. Failing to achieve a score of 90% or above, would result in the student being declared "Failed" in that particular course and they would either have to drop out of the course or retake it.

As of now, there are 10 departments in the university under Computer Science and Engineering. They are as follows:

1. Basics of Computer Science and Engineering, and Program Design
2. Hardware, Digital Logic, and Embedded Systems. 
3. Mathematics of Computer Science and Engineering
4. Theoretical Computer Science, Software Project Management, and Operating Systems
5. Computer Networking and Cryptography, Database Management Systems, and Computer Graphics
6. Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and Robotics
7. Quantum Physics, Quantum Computing, and Quantum Machine Learning
8. Biotechnology and Computational Biology
9. Open-Source Contribution, Competitive Programming, and Entrepreneurship
10. Career Preparation in CSE

All the courses under each of these departments are free-of-cost with no extra charges. After completion of each course, an online certificate, after completion of each specialized track, an online transcript, and after completion of all listed courses, an online degree and an online transcript would be provided to each student. All the online certifiactes, transcripts, and degree would be printable.
